# CompleteWrapperClass
- This whole tree consist of all the method and properties and constructer of the wrapper class in java.
### `What is a wrapper class?`
- Wrapper class are the class which convets out primitive data types to objcet  reference and vice versa.
### Why this is used ?
- As the feature of the object oriented language the language should only support the cocept of the class and object but primitve data types are not the class or object.
- So we need some concept which can convert that data types to object reference.
- We have corresponding wrapper class for all the primitive data types.
- `boolean -> Boolean`
- `byte -> Byte`
- `short -> Short`
- `int -> Integer`
- `float -> Float`
- `long -> Long`
- `double -> Double`
- To perform operation on the wrapper class we have some inbuilt properties and mehtod for that.
- In this tree i will go through all the internal method and explain all the feature.
- I will make all separate folder for all the wrapper class and make separate `Readme.md` for all.
- You all can find this with the command javap fullyQualified classname.
#### Happy learning
